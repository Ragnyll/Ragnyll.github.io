&nbsp;Yo.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Jake. I'm a software engineer and bboy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name Ragnyll comes from my World of Warcraft days. I had an undead rogue that I named Ragnyll. Pretty much everyone in my guild (Frogz) called me Rag.
So now that's my online presence everywhere I go.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love linux. When I first got into programming I always wanted to create the environment that was totally mine.
 If a system is gonna lock me into some certain way of thinking, then I don't like it.
 As such, I'm very particular about how any computer I use should work. I'm sure you'll find out through this blog just how opinionated I am.
 Currently, my favorite programming language is Rust.
 I love the safety the language provides and think that it's just fun to write.
 Python is a close second.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been breakin since 2012, representing Arch Enemies Crew since 2017, and teaching at Street Styles Academy since 2020.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel free to get in contact with me via email (blog@gallowzhumour.dev).
