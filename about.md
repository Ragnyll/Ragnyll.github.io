Yo.

I'm Jake. I'm a software engineer, bboy, and a critic of virtually everything. 

The name Ragnyll comes from my World of Warcraft days. I had an undead rogue that I named Ragnyll. Pretty much everone in my guild (Frogz) called me Rag. 
So now that's my online presence everywhere I go.

I love linux. When I first got into programming I always wanted to create the environment that was totally mine. 
If a system is gonna lock me into some certain way of thinking, then I don't like it. As such, I'm very particular about how any compmuter I use should work. I'm sure you'll find out through this blog just how opinionated I am.
Python is my language of choice as it's basically my swiss army knife when it come to solving problems. 
I also really just _do not care_ about front end design. There's some improvments that will come for the usability of this site, but if you're looking for a pretty looking blog this is not the one for you. It really should come as no surprise, given the previous statement, that I mostly prefer working in the back end, in the terminal. 

For my breakin career, I've been goin for 6 years now. I rep Basement Dwellers Crew (KCMO) and Arch Enemies (STL).
I'm a footwork head, to me it makes sense with how I think about the movement. Maybe you'll see some videos up here, I dunno. Haven't really decided yet.

One more thing. The language in this blog is probably gonna be pretty harsh.
I really don't give a shit about being nice with how I word my opinions. If you dont like that, then get the hell out.
That being said, I do welcome critism and corrections with anyhting I may post. 
Feel free to get in contact with me via email (justanotherjakeyg@gmail.com).

Stay salty kids.
