&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing a resume for your second job can potentially be more
difficult than the first. For your first you either don't have any experience,
or maybe just an internship, and that's kind of expected. There are very few
requirements on entry level software engineers and passing a code screen and
some silly HR teamwork questions is often all you need to land a job. The
resume for your second job has to fill a very different role. It must show that
you have developed some level of technical expertise, contributed meaningfully
to team projects, and that you aspire to do more with your career. That's a
tall order for what is likely a one-page resume. It can be difficult to
communicate all this information without being excessively wordy, but you also
have to hit the right set of words to get past automated screens and the
occasional HR person that might be the first set of eyes on your resume before
it even lands on the desk of an engineer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I'll share what I think are some good tips and a
general format for writing your second resume. Keep in mind, these are only my
opinions. I am not a recruiter and not a manager. I'm just a mid-level software
engineer with an ego who has looked at some truly crappy resumes belonging to
my peers. There's not a "right way" to write a resume, just a ton of wrong
ways. So hopefully this will help you upgrade your resume into something
halfway decent.

## Part 1: The Header
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your resume needs a header with the following information:
- name
- phone number
- email address

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optionally, you can include a title. I would only include
that if you have a PhD or something that not every other candidate can also put
on their resume.

## Part 2: Education
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here add your alma mater, when you graduated, your GPA, and
your major(s) and minor(s). If you have any certifications this can be an
"Education and Certifications" section.

## Part 3: Employment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time for the most important part of your resume, your
employment. In this section you will enumerate your places of employment
(likely only one or two places) and postions (likely only one or two
positions). Start by listing all employment history down to internships (high
school jobs or retail jobs are not worth adding after you've had your first
position for a few years). Add the general time (month + year) that you held
the position.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under each title list your "accomplishments" while you
worked in that position. I air quote accomplishments because this can also be
core job responsibilities, just phrased in a way that implies you accomplished
something (even if you didn't). Basically, just state what you did as directly
and assertively as possible.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some example phrases you can use under this
section.

- Developed "X" to accomplish "Y" using "Z" technology
- Automated "X" using "Y" to simplify "Z".
- Managed "X" project to achieve "Y" result.
- Led "X" to accomplish "Y".
- Maintained "X" system used to process "Y" data to ensure high availabilty.
- Mentored "X" engineers to obtain "Y" skill.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The list goes on, but you should notice a general format
emerging from this. You did some _specific_ that accomplished some _specific_
task using some _specific_ technology or methodology. Each one of these should
be a potential talking point in your interview. These statements do simplify
the story, but unless questioned on them then it's fine. If you are questioned
about any points in this section you should be able to answer them without
missing a beat. Each one of these points should be a story that you have
rehearsed in your head and have thought about every possible path a
conversation about the topic could go down. That may sound like a lot of work,
but it is necessary to be well prepared.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If writing in this format is difficult, just start by
writing down all the things you did at that position, you can work on polishing
up later.

## Part 4: Technical Skills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next up you should list your technical skills. This can
include a variety of information from programming lanagues, to frameworks, to
technical stacks, or operating system skills. This section should not take up
too much space on your resume. If your resume lands on an engineeing manager's
desk and there is a clear mismatch between a candidates purported skills and
their job experience this can raise questions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever skill you put on this section you should ask
yourself, "could I handle an entire interview solely regarding the nuances of this skill?" If the answer is yes, go ahead and put it on there. If not, you may
consider omitting it. However, omitting something that shows up in your job
responsibilities can be a double edged sword. For instance, if you work in some analytics
stack, but don't have any analytics tech in your skills then that might also be
a red flag. If you are in this scenario where you have a job responsibility that you
are a little uncomfortable interviewing on this may be a sign that you need to
pick up a book prior to your interview so you can speak reasonably well about
this skill. Not all interviewers will grill you like this, so depending on
where you are interviewing you may or may not embellish this section a bit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is my "Technical Skills" section from my last resume as
an example. I personally put skills that I am most interested in first, even
ahead of things I may be better at. The ordering is largely preference, but try to make what you want to catch the most attention come first.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with your employment information I would just dump
everything you know on this section initially then pare it down after your
first draft.

## Personal Projects and Extracurriculars:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on where you are applying it can be useful to talk
a little bit about your life outside of work. This can come in various forms,
from volunteerism, mentoring, or personal projects. Often when interviewing
candiates the interviewer (or in some cases the HR person) is looking for
someone who shows their passion for their field via open source work or helps
out in their community somehow. This lets them use you for positive PR
gimmicks, or at least lets them say "oh, our employees care about the
community" or some bullshit like that. All of this is secondary to their bottom
line, so your employment and technical skills better be up to snuff, but it
can be the cherry on top of your resume.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are advertising personal projects, include the name
of the project, the tech stack, and what it does. Unless it is a major open
source project then you don't need to write a ton here, just a sentence or two
explaining what it is.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are writing some sort of community involvment thing
on your resume (technology related or not), treat it like your employment
section. If you organize some sports group, that's fair game. Point out the
scope and responsibilities, just like a job.

## No "Objective Statment"?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may have noticed that I do not include any "objective"
section in this resume. That may have been useful on a entry level software
engineer resume, but it has no place after that. The objective statement would
likely say what tech you are interested in working on, but that interest should
be obvious based on the specific position you are applying to. When applying to
mid or senior level positions you are applying for specific teams that have
their full responsibilities and desired skill sets listed on the posting. This
isnt always true for FAANG jobs, but as a general statement I find that it
holds. If you are switching major tech stacks you are working on (like moving
from analytics to front end work) then a cover letter becomes nessecary.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can think of a cover letter as an extended objective
statement. But where the objective statement is only one sentence that likely
doesn't make the case for your interest, the cover letter makes up for that. It
gives you the room to make the case for why your skills are transferrable, and
lets you talk about what it is that interests you in that realm of technology.
I reccomend having a cover letter ready for almost every job you apply for.
Once you have one it is a relatively low effort task to adjust it for a given
position and it can help set your application apart from someone who has the
same experience, but no letter.

# Other info and closing thoughts:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The resume is the first step in your job hunt and it pays to
get it right. Have several people review it. Have your teammates review it, an
engineering manager (for obvious reasons probably not your current manager), a
professional editor, and an engineer on the team you are applying for if you
can manage that. Once you have your resume keep a version saved for every
position you apply to (so the resume you are looking at is consistent with what
the interviewer has in hand), then keep updating a base copy every few months
while your experience is fresh in your mind. After you have a good resume write
a cover letter. You may not use it with every application but it's useful to
have ready for the ones that you really care about.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once all the written material is out of the way start
applying. I would start with a job that you don't care about and know that you
won't take. Getting an interview out of the way can be a big boost to your
confidence or show you what you need to improve most on. Also, apply to Google.
Even if you don't want to work there, it will likely be the most difficult
coding interview that you have, so preparing for that will help with every
other application. Then, I would start applying to one position a night, for
about two weeks. With 14 active applications your chances of getting a few
calls are not bad (for me the hit rate was just over 40%). While doing all this
you probably want to start working on your code interview skills.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This last though is a gamble, but worth considering.
Depending on how serious you are about finding a new position, it may be worth
leaving your current job. There are a **lot** of factors here to consider, but
preparing for interviews is almost like a full time job by itself. Often
interviews gauge a completely different skillset than what you have in your current
position (or stupidly enough, the position you are applying for). Taking the
time to solely focus on being ready for the interview process can pay off, and even if you do get an
offer joining already burnt out when you start that can also be very
tough. Regardless of what you choose to do you need to have a plan. Interviewing can
easily burn you out mentally, physically, and emotionally. So be prepared.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good luck. Dont die.
