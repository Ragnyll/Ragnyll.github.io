&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I've been using Rust for a bit over a year now, so I figure why not write a blog post reminiscing why I got myself into this mess.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was hanging out in one my friends Discord server's, everyone was gaming but I was programming.
 As always, I'm on my high horse because I use Arch Linux (btw) and I was talking about how I love it because I get a little less abstraction around the working of my computer.
  Then one of my buddies hit me with a tough question:

> If you hate abstraction, why is Python your favorite language?
> Isn't that like one of the most abstract languages out there?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He kinda got me with that one, I didn't have a good retort, because he was right.
 Python is great, but its really high level.
 I learned it in college because I was really shitty at C++ and I needed some way to get my CS homework done.
 In the long run I think I made the right call doing that, but if I was going talk shit on people for using languages like JavaScript I probably needed to learn something that would give me something to satisfy my dipshit ego.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what were my options?
  I narrowed it down to 3 possibilities:
1. C++
1. Go
1. Rust

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C++ should be an obvious pick for any systems programmer, but I had such an absolutely fucking horrible experience with it in college I suffered flashback any time I touched it.
 Also, while C++ has gotten better over the years, there's just tons of old documentation that I would have to search through to find what is still relevant.
 Finally it lacked a lot of niceties of modern languages, like a strong package manager and consistent build system.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second up, was Go.
 In all honestly, I probably should have picked Go instead.
 It's way easier, is super widely used across the industry, and is pretty easy to pick up (from what I hear).
 Unfortunately, being my dumbass self, I was feuding with Google at the time over their information privacy policies and took a vehement stance in opposition to anything they owned.
 Google and big tech's privacy stance is a rat's nest that I don't really want to unpack right now (frankly because my opinions are pretty half baked), but I've since revised my stance on Google products.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally there was Rust.
 I'd heard a decent amount about it, particularly about it's notoriously high learning curb, but despite that it checked a lot of boxes for me.

- It was pretty new
- It had a good package manager
- It was a manual memory managed language (unlike Go)
- The community around it seemed strong

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all that in mind, I set off on the long journey of learning it.
 It was pretty damn hard (and it still is at times), but I'm glad I did.
 The people workin' on the language are inspiring, and I enjoy building things in it.
 I've since built few medium scale projects, threw a few commits at an open source project, done a bunch of fucking LeetCode problems, listened to every single Rustacean Station podcast, and devoured one book about it.
 I think I've become an even more opinionated developer than before, but those opinions I think have done well for my career and made me a better reviewer and designer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point I'll have to do some more deep dives on specific Rust concept, but I really wanted to talk about how I ended up at this point in my programming journey.
