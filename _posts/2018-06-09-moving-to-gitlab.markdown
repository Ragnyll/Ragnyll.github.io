&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm one of the skeptic psychopaths who jumped ship from Github shortly after it got bought out from Microsoft.
 I made a mad dash to Gitlab (after reading their user agreement) and imported all my repositories from Github.
 It was surprisingly not difficult.
 I guess the owners of Gitlab wanted to take advantage of the situation and get some new users out the deal. 
 After I moved my repos over and got my blog hosted (interestingly enough gitlab also can host Jekyll blogs) I started looking for some reasons to legitimize my hatred of Microsoft.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've complained a lot about Microsoft, though since I've started doing some research I've found that maybe I've cast the die a little too early.
 My primary complaint is that I think all their products are junk. 
 I'll double down on that.
 After the core Microsoft Office suite was realeased years ago nothing else good has come since then.
 I think that Teams is junk, it's hard to navigate, the way chat threads are managed I think are moronic, and you can't forward the traffic through any sort or IRC bounce and read it in a more usable setting.
 VSCode I also don't like since it's built off the memory hog that is electron (any more argument about electron is not exactly the discussion I want to get into here).
 The user interface for Windows 10 is atrocious, not very customizable (at a minimum, being able to control my own hotkey daemon is very important to me), and it's constantly interrupting what I'm doing with some notification from Microsoft or some other installed software thats super annoying to silence. 
 On the computer I have that has Windows on it I don't think I've been able to turn it on once with out being force fed some shitty new update. 
 In short, as a user with some level of technical acumen, I feel like the products are pandering to lower level users without any option for people who want to go beyond default settings and really own their computer.
 Linux does that. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm getting sidetracked here.
 This isn't supposed to be another Windows vs Linux rant, but the issue is that I've let my distaste for some of the Microsoft products cloud my judgement of Microsoft as a company.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could Microsoft's buyout of Github really be that bad?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking for some excuse to justify my salt I'm actually unsure.
 The common arguments are those of paranoia. 
 Believe me, I'm pretty paranoid.
 Maybe not as much as some of the other basement dwellers I know, but most definitely more than the average person who will hand over their entire life to Facebook then act surprised when they find out that their personal data is being used for advertisements and other "research".
 The answer to this question rests on what kind of stewards Microsoft will be of the open source community.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm skeptically optimistic that Microsoft will be good keepers of the open source community.
 I've read the fabled ["Halloween Document"][1], and that was pretty disturbing when it comes to their stance on open source technologies, but that was back in 2004 (when the last one came out), and it seems since then they've changed their colors since then.
 VSCode is (while I still dont like it) one of the larger open source projects on Github (even before the takeover).
 Microsoft was at one point one of the top contributors to Linux.
 [Though they aren't anymore][2], they've still done a lot for operating systems that I prefer much more to Windows.
 There are some developers with personal beef with MS, but those that I've read it seems like MS [has been respectful towards open source developers who come after them][3].
 I think as stewards they will probably be ok. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time to put the tinfoil hat on.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still worried though.
 Is this a plot to buy out the biggest OSS platform, drive it into the ground (Microsoft owned Skype makes me cry), and kill the competition? 
 Will this lead to more censorship of the OSS community if Microsoft really is in bed with the NSA?
 There's also the interesting question of how they will handle open source projects that actively threaten their own products, such as xbox emulators.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, it all comes down to just an uncomfortable feeling I get from my distrust of a lot of large companies.
 Could this all be fine? Maybe.
 I'm not about to stick around and find out the hard way though.
 If a couple years from now everything is rosy I might come back to Github.
 My account will remain open, so I can contribute (whatever negligible amount that may be) to others' projects, but I'll give Gitlab a try.
 So Gitlab, this is your chance to impress me.
 I'm already here, and so far the features seem ok.
 Same to you Microsoft. Try and win me back.
