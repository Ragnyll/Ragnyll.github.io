&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a little something different today.
 Instead of a writeup on something, heres a youtube video demoing a prototype for how I edit breaking software.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I plan on eventually writing this in rust, in hopes that I can speed up the file write time.
 Also my code is pretty messy write now, with some (imo) bad handling around existing files, but python is good for quick prototyping and this is that.
 Here's the repo with the code: [breaking_move_editor](https://gitlab.com/Ragnyll/breaking_move_editor).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Code stuff aside, I think the tool is useful to me, but probably not anyone who doesn't think in object code.
 Whatever system people come up with keep their moves straight in their head will always be the route to go, but I think this was a good thought exercise, and has saved me a lot of time in editing footage and organizing it.
