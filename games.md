# Game Ratings #
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's my ratings of various video games. If I have written a review of it it will be linked in the game name. I think that it's also worth noting that it's hard to compare a lot of these games against each other. For instance I may have _enjoyed_ a game more than another but appreciate the tone of another, thus resulting in some weird scores. Each score should be looked at sort of independently. That being said I almost certainly think games that I give high scores to are better than games I give low scores to.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_For games that I have beaten in the past and don't remember the date it will just be 01/01/2000 (Y2K bby!)_

| Game Name | Date First Completed | Times Completed | Score (100 max) |
| The Last of Us Part II | 06/27/2020 | 1 | 93 |
| Nier: Automata | 01/01/2000 | 1 | 92 |
| Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild | 01/01/2000 | 1 | 65 |
